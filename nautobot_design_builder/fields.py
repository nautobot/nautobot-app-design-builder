"""This module includes the proxy model field descriptors.

The way design builder handles attribute assignment is with descriptors. This
allows assignment of values directly to the proxy model and the descriptors
handle any necessary deferrals.

For instance, `ForeignKey` relationships require that foreign key object be
present in the database before the receiving object (object with the
`ForeignKey` field) can be saved. When design builder encounters this situation
there are some cases (for example, setting IP addresses on interfaces) where
assignment must be deferred in order to guarantee the parent object is present
in the database prior to save.

Another example is the reverse side of foreign key relationships. Consider a `Device` which
has many `Interface` objects. The device foreign key is defined on the `Interface` object,
but we would typically model this in design builder as such:

```yaml
devices:
  # additional attributes such as device type, role, location, etc
  # are not illustrated here.
  - name: "My Device"
    interfaces:
      - name: "Ethernet1"
        # type, status, etc
      - name: "Ethernet2"
        # type, status, etc
```

In order to save these objects to the database, the device must be saved first, and
then each interface's device foreign key is set and saved.

Since design builder generally processes things in a depth first order, the natural sequence
is for the interfaces (in the above example) to be created first. Therefore, the
`ManyToOneRelField` will handle creating an instance of Interface but deferring database
save until after the device is saved.
