# Upgrading the App

Here you will find any steps necessary to upgrade the App in your Nautobot environment.

## Upgrade Guide

Since Design Builder does not currently include any custom data models the only requirement for updating is to update the `nautobot-design-builder` package using the `pip` command:

```python
pip install --upgrade nautobot-design-builder
```
