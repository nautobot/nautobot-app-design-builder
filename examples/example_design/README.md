# Design Builder Designs

This repository includes all of the files related to the designs.

For local testing, start the development stack with `invoke start` and navigate to <https://localhost:8080> in your browser. The designs should show up as they would in a production environment.

To see the debug output from the Nautobot application stack, open a new terminal and run `invoke debug`

To run the unit tests, open a terminal panel and run the command `invoke unittest`
